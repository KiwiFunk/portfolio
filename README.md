# Portfolio Website

<a href="https://www.kiwifunk.com">Deployed site here!</a>

A static site for linking to my social media platforms such as GitHub and ArtStation, and providing an overview of experience, skills, and linking to recent projects.

Sections like projects are populated from data contained within a JSON file making it easy to add new entries. On a site of a bigger scale this could be expanded to pull from a database - but given the low traffic and infrequent updates, it's simply easier to do this from a local file.

### Testing
